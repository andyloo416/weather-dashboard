This assignment was meant to incorporate the weather API and display it's data on the page based on a search of a particular city. The city search is based on longitude and latitude when a city is typed into the search bar it uses the data in the weather API to apply the longitude and latitude of that city to the current weather conditions. The weather API has all the data stored in it that is needed for the above criteria what was necessary in this assignment was to access that data and display it to the page. Temp, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and the 5 day forecast for that city was required as outlined above. The 5 day forecast needed to display icons of the future condition as well as the date for the next 5 days starting with the date of tommorrow. This was the challenging part of the assignment and thus took the most amount of time to complete.
